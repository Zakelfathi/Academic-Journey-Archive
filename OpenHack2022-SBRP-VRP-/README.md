# Vehicle Routing Problem: School Bus Routing Problem



We want to formulate and design an algorithm to solve a specific case of The Vehicle Routing Problem (**VRP**) which is The School Bus Routing Problem (**SBRP**). A VRP is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (**TSP**) but in a more complex way. The Vehicle Routing Problem (**VRP**) is everywhere, and solving it is critical in helping to facilitate the movement of goods and services from one place to another. Essentially, you have a fleet of vehicles and a collection of stops. Youâ€™re trying to figure out:

 1. Which vehicle should I assign to each stop?
    
  
 2. In what order should the vehicles visit those stops to minimize
    distance and travel time (while satisfying any other constraints you might have)

The School Bus Routing problem (SBRP) is concerned with transporting students from their homes (or a near station to their home) to their schools via transportation systems such as buses. The SBRP resembles the VRP; however, there are some specific characteristics of the problem and these are outlined below:

 - The total number of students each bus carries cannot exceed the capacity of the bus.
 - The bus should first pick up the students before visiting the schools.
