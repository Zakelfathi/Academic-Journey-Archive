# Welcome to my repository for a Python implementation of the Simplex Method using PyQt5 and the Big M method.
#
This code was developed as a tool for solving linear programming problems and is inspired by the implementation found in the repository  [https://github.com/Buerkem/Gui-Simplex-Algorithm-Implementation-Python].
#
This code includes a user-friendly graphical interface built with PyQt5, making it easy to input and understand the problem and results. The Big M method  is implemented to handle infeasible and unbounded problems, making the code more versatile.
#
Feel free to use and modify this code for your own projects, and let me know if you have any suggestions or issues.
